ChiSky Flight Tracker is an experminetal flight tracker implementing SQL databases to bring you flight information using the FlightAware AeroAPI.
Created by 4 students for our Database Orginization course, ChiSky is the pinacle of our semester of learning. Going above and beyond, the application has access to the AeroAPI and can update itself.  
Run an SQL Query and access our database on our Query page, learn about and contact the team on the About page, or moniter and track flights above IIT's campus on our Map page!.
